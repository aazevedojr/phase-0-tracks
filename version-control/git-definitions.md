# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Through a tool like Git, you can save your work in a repository as you update it. Each save is a version of that work. Using version control, you can access different versions (saves) of that work in order to, for instance, detect when exactly a bug started occurring and what is causing it.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

It is a work environment parallel to the main environment used to develop specific features of a project without risking compromising the main project. The main project will be located in the master branch or trunk, while branches should be created to change or add specific features to the project independently.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

It is a new save to the repository that may be accessed in the future, even after newer saves (commits) are created. A commit message should be brief but specific and readable by anyone else that might be involved in the project.

* What is a merge conflict?

Merge conflicts happen when two independent branches have had the same section of code or information updated differently and you attempt to merge these two branches.
