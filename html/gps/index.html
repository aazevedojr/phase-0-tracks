<!--
  What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
      They mean something very specific and will be interpreted differently by the browser depending on which tag is used.
      I find <h1> - <h6> tags to be very useful. As well as <table> and <form> tags.
  
  What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
      Order of appearance within the HTML file.
  
  What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
      I learned about snippets. Creating a useful snippet for HTML was actually the first thing I did after finishing our hangout section.
  
  What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
      None, really. This challenge was very chill.
