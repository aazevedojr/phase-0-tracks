# jQuery

1. Get familiarized with jQuery on Codecademy (just because I was told not to);
2. Immediately regret studying on Codecademy because their drills are too simple and the challenges are too slow paced;
3. Practice jQuery by updating my personal website with some cool stuff I've learned;
3. Use jQuery to make the pictures in my personal website pop up when clicked on.
